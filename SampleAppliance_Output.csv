This seemed to be the only option and it is barely adequate. It does catch a lot of the lint but fine particles seem to escape at will. We have to dust the condo after every wash day. I didn't see any better options out there.

By the way, it is cheaply made, be gentle with it or you will mess it up.

*****Update****

After using this thing for about 9 months we have decided to stop using our dryer in the condo. I changed it from 3 stars to 1. It just doesn't catch enough lint and when we did a spring cleaning by moving furniture and the washer / dryer to clean up dust bunnies it was obvious it does a very poor job of eliminating lint from escaping into the rest of our condo. It was gross, and to think we've been breathing that stuff in. And, yes, we followed instructions, made sure there was plenty of water in the basin and we cleaned it out each time we used it. I do not recommend this product. We prefer going to the laundry building in our complex rather than use the dryer with the lint catcher.","No longer using it, it just doesn't do the job",1364774400,"['Appliances', 'Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Dryer Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Vents']",Dryer Vents,Deflecto,Tools &amp; Home Improvement,13.9,-0.9,Negative,-0.4,7.8,-0.05

It covers the garbage disposal drain very well. Too well in fact.  EVERYTHING sits on top of it.  So I have to shove everything down manually.  It's ridiculous.  Even the smallest bits of food get stuck on top of it and clog up the sink.  So I have to reach my hand down there to shove stuff down.  And it's not just a one time push, it takes several attempts.

The plastic is too hard so it doesn't flex to let anything down the drain.  I even cut it to make the hole a little bigger but all food still sits on top.

So if you want a disposal drain cover that doesn't let anything down the drain.  Buy this.  If you are SUPER green and want something to force you to compost even the smallest bit of food. Buy this.  If you want to swear at a $3 piece of plastic daily.  But this.

But if you want most things to go down into your disposal so it can do it's job. Look elsewhere.

This item works great.  Range is not a problem as some suggested.  It plugs into a standard outlet in the bottom socket with no problem and leaves enough room above to get my dishwasher plugged into the top socket without issue.  The remote comes with a holster for wall mounting if you desire.  After installing it my wife actually prefers it to our old dishwasher with a switch on the wall.  You don't have to touch an electric switch with wet hands and make a mess of a wall socket.  If you want to keep this switch super clean just put it in a zip-lock bag.

Remember to buy the remote batteries separately as they are not easy to find locally but Amazon has them without issue.  I don't know that I would stick my hand down the disposal with a remote controlled switch without first unplugging but that is good practice regardless.  There is a switch on the socket for always on or you simply use the remote to power off and on.  I am sure it would also be great for other remote control electrical uses such as lights (possibly outside) or other appliances.  We simply love ours and are glad we gave it a try.

It isn't very stretchable, but the bars are so thin, I didn't really have a problem with adjusting it. Second, the smell: On my first use, I had the oven at 475 degrees F. (the max is 500). The product gave off a strong chemical smell. I haven't used the oven a second time since then, so I don't know if the smell will linger. Third, the product isn't long enough to stretch the entire length of the oven racks, so there's a couple of inches that are bare on either end if you center it.

In the last few months I also started to have major problems with the ice maker overflowing and freezing up. I probably pulled the whole ice maker and bucket out a dozen times to let it completly defrost after it had overflowed and formed a giant ice glob.

I finally got tired of dealing with this and was about to buy a replacement ice maker when stumbling across this part. I didn't think the tray alone could be causing the problems I was having but after reading another review with similar problems I decided to give it a shot before ordering a whole new unit.

The new tray looked exactly like the old except for a shine on the new one indicating a much smoother surface. Overtime the surface of the old tray had worn and become rough enough that the ice was sticking to it instead of breaking out cleanly. When dumping ice into the bucket this caused the ice to shatter and leave chunks stuck to the tray which eventually caused overflows.

For the first time in years I have a ice bucket full of solid ice cubes instead of shattered pieces! I had no idea the tray would make such a big difference!

so whats with the 3*? my brush broke inside my vent!!!! while i was pulling it out, and yes i was using a drill, all the pieces came out except the round brush. i had to climb to my attic and push it from the other side to come out... what was supposed to be an easy task ended up with me spending over an hour extra in climbing in my attic, disassembling the HVAC pipe so that i can get in there and push down on the brush...

another minus for this kit is that while it is fairly bendy, it will not go very smoothly through your flexible insulated pipes and most likely push the pipe out from its connector.

with all that said, if your vent duct doesnt have to many bends, and you want to take the risk (maybe i had a defective kit that the brush broke), you might save a lot of money doing it yourself!",good kit with some caveats,1480982400,"['Appliances', 'Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Dryer Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Vents']",Dryer Vents,LintEater,Tools &amp; Home Improvement,29.09,0.5,Positive,-0.2,6.3,-0.03

It was leaking out the bottom, the sides, and the top. (I figured a way to put the lid on to prevent it from leaking out the top, but it still leaks from the sides and bottom.)

The second time I used this, I put it in the bathtub instead. It still leaks, but now it doesn't matter.

I read nearly all the reviews before deciding to purchase this. My goal was to have a way to hand wash delicates like bras and wool sweaters. Currently I do those items in a big bucket, but they never seem to come out clean. The armpits of my bras are especially hard to clean and there is often deodorant and sweat build up in them.

I knew to expect that this would be a somewhat flimsy device that leaked, and that's exactly how I experienced the Wonderwash. Still, it was fast and effective. My bras came out cleaner than any time I ever hand washed them, and the overall effort to get them clean was less. I particularly like the way the water drains out the bottom rather than me needing to fish my bras out of a bucket of water.

I doubt I would enjoy using this as my *only* form of clothes washer, but as a way to handwash delicate items I am quite satisfied with it.

2389,4,5,True,"01 12, 2014",A9KA8B8RLHJX9,B002C8HR9A,Marion G. Seltzer,"We got this because the washer quit right before the holidays and we wanted to wait and buy a replacement washing machiune when appliances went on sale.  Now that I have this, I will never buy another washing machine.  Love it.

- I recommend putting it up on a counter, workbench, etc.  Ours is on our head washing machine.  I think putting it down in the bathtub is awkward.

- I also recommend filling it with a hose instead of trying to hold the tub under a faucet.  I disconnected the water hoses to our dead washer and use those.

-- Some people dump the tub over because they don't like to wait for the Wonderwash to drain on its own.  I use the drain pipe and let it fall into the utility sink.  I think I will switch to a five-gallon bucket at some point and use the gray water outdoors for gardening or landscape plants.

-- The clothes look better than they did using the regular washer.  I think the compression pushes out the dinge by percolating out the old detergent from previous washes.

-- I bought a janitorial mop wringer and bucket to squeeze out the clothes.  I hang most of the wash on the basement clothesline and then do the rest in the dryer.  Some people buy a little electric spin dryer.

-- The tub holds about half of the normal load I use to put in.  It takes less time to do each load, though.  I can put both the top and bottom queen-size bedsheets in and then do the pillowcases with the towels.  If I was doing king size sheets, I'd just do the top and bottom sheets separately.  I do one or two tubfuls of laundry daily and our clothes hamper is usually empty for the first time in my life.

-- I timed out the spins and for a normal load, I spin the washing tub moderately slow 30 times in each direction.  If the clothes are very dirty I do double the number of spins.  To rinse, I can do more like 15 or 20 spins each way.

-- The stand has suction cups on the bottom but I put mine on an old bath towel as I splash a bit as I pull out wet clothes.

-- It was easy to assemble it.  Five minutes tops.

-- I use a fourth of the detergent I used to use, and much less water.  The dryer runs a bit longer as the towels and jeans don't spin dry but I hang most of my stuff on the line so I use the same amount of electricity to run the dryer or maybe a little less.

-- The shipping speed was fantastic.  I think I got it the day after I ordered it.

*** UPDATE: The Wonder Wash lasted over a year, with a lot of use. I literally used it every day. One day the glue quit on the axle peg which holds the tub to the supporting frame. I tried to repair it, but couldn't figure out a solution. I have now switched to a plastic laundry plunger.  I got my money's worth out of the Wonder Wash, and it got me started with doing my laundry without a machine. I am glad I bought it.

We live in an apartment with a laundry facility that charges $1.50 per wash and $1.25 per dryer cycle, so I have been spending about $30-40 each month to do laundry. Since I am home a lot, the Wonderwash fits perfectly into my lifestyle. I can throw a batch of clothes in, sit by the tub and crank the washer for a few mins while my toddler sits on the potty. Then I take the lid off, attach the drain spout, and come back in 10 mins to add water to rinse. I've been soaking heavily soiled or stinky things overnight in the Wonderwash, rinsing them in the morning, then hanging everything on a standing clothes drying rack that fits perfectly in my tub. It only takes a couple minutes to rinse and hang things up.

I don't mind hanging things to dry, since I realize I mostly used the laundry facility's dryer because I couldn't really carry a whole basket of wet laundry back to my apartment.

The Wonderwash is light enough that even with a full load, I can lift it out of the tub and set it on the floor if I need to take a shower while something is still in the washer. It is so nice to be able to do it all in my apartment w/o leaving my toddler alone. It's especially great for washing things that need immediate attention to prevent a stain from setting, and I don't feel wasteful for not waiting for enough dirty laundry to pile up to make a full load. The $48 + shipping I paid for this is easily going to save me hundreds of dollars a year.

I would have given this 5 stars if there were a spin cycle attribute. It seems like there should be some way to make it drain water by cranking it the same way to make the water spin out. It would have to have an internal way to collect the water so it didn't spray everywhere.

there is tape at the seam directly dividing the unit.  it is moist like the unit is leaking.

no invoice, no warranty information, no replacement part information, no information on how to contact the company.

I decided to go open box to save the cash and since it seemed a lot of these were arriving dented anyway...for my purpose it was fine. Kids will (or I will) probably dent it anyway in the future.

I was however disappointed because I think the previous buyer attempted to change the swing of the door and clean cut a screw for the bottom bracket in half inside the fridge. When I moved it out of the box the severed half fell out. This caused the door to not swing properly. After a few attempts, some beer, a pairnof pliers, and some washers I got the door to work properly. It wasn't worth the hassle to return. 5 hours later I plugged it in and its chilling my beers.

Well I hide that junk in the big fridge with stainless doors so it can't be seen.  The beers however I proudly display in the Danby DBC120BLS BEVERAGE CENTER. So sexy! Every time I wander into the kitchen BAM there's cold beers staring at me through the glass like a puppy in a pet store. (puppies only cats are like sodas keep them behind the stainless). Cats suck.....kittens too.

A little tip for you inexperienced  folks, start your beer drinking from the bottom shelf. It will be easier to grab from the higher shelves as the beers side effects kick in.

Another tip: (This is only necessary if beer is stocked)... get some of those stickers that old people put on glass doors to keep them from walking face first into it.  Some friends and folk that stop by for a cold one will freak the ?%** out when they see this Danby DBC120BLS BEVERAGE CENTER stocked with some of daddy's sweet sauce in a can, they may damage their wrist,  or possibly their face reaching for a can. I suggest stickers of the dragonfly because dragonflies are badass. NOT as badass as puppies but badass nonetheless.

Last tip: Buy this fridge. I got this machine on sale for 199. free shipping. I researched it one week and the next week the clever individuals at Amazon sent me an email showing it on sale. Clever bastards.

Yes it has an internal fan that circulates the air but in my case the thermostat does nothing, all the way on one end the fridge shuts off, anywhere else it's 50 deg F. Glad i bought the service plan.
I replaced the internal bulb with an LED one (the feit candelabra ones work) but i had to remove the transparent cover and trim a little bit of the bulb enclosure at the opposite end from the socket. Looks much nicer now.

One more thing about this fridge is that the condenser on it si built into the sides, not in the rear. So don't mount this flush on the sides with furniture or other appliances because it won't be able to do it's job.

I was kind of afraid to order, as there are a lot of reviews on here that says they had shipping damage.  Well, I decided to go for it, and guess what.....I too had shipping damage.  The top left corner of the door and the unit was bashed in.  The unit damage I didn't care too much about, as it is under my bar and you can't see it, but the door was a huge eye sore.

I called Amazon about this, and recieved great customer service.  They gave me the number to Danby and said if there is anything owed, just to let them (Amazon) know and they would cover any costs.

I called Danby, and called Danby, and called Danby, and left messages.  The phone was always busy, or it was after hours.  Finally I left another message and a guy called me back.  This took about 4 days of calling.  Anyway, at first they said that they do not ship parts or doors to consumers, but then he talked to his manager, and agreed to ship a new door to me.

Door arrived pretty promptly, so thanks to Danby for that.  It also did not have the Danby sticker or the warning stickers on it....so thanks for that as well....it looks better!  Door was easy to install, and they didn't ask for the old door back.  Cool.

Now my only other issue with it, is it seems to run constantly.  At first I had it turned to MAX, and it was cold enough, but ran all the time, I tried a medium setting, and now it's just barely cold enough, but still seems to run all the time.  Is this normal?

Also, the sides stay very warm.

I quickly concluded that it was more than likely the igniter.  I then researched the model # for a replacement igniter.  The replacement igniter cost around $60 so I did some more research and determined that I could use this igniter instead and it cost a lot less. I received the igniter, installed it and everything works great.  The research I did, showed that you can typically replace square igniters with other square igniters and round igniters with other round igniters.  From my research, it appears that square igniters draw one amount of current and round igniters draw a different amount of current.  Obviously keep a close eye on the general size so that the replacement will fit in and also look at the mounting bracket to make sure it's compatible.

They were matching numbers. So I ordered it. The shape is not exact but the area that it differs is not relevant. It is a plastic mold around a wire screen. The old lint trap used a softer mesh. The felt sides that keep the lint from passing around the filter are not as thick as the original one. I would have liked them to have stuck out a little more so, to prevent lint from getting past better, but all in all the filter works fine. I am holding on to the old one for awhile...just in case.

My 2 cents: If you have never taken your dryer part and vacuumed the inside of it (the parts that you don't see) you should. There are plenty of video out there that will show you how to take apart your dryer. The lint that get past the lint trap over the years accumulates on the motor and the bottom of the dryer. Huge fire hazard. If you are too nervous to take your dryer apart and put it back together have a professional do it. Also never leave your home with the dryer running. While you are at it...your exhaust fans in your bathroom and the coils on you fridge will thank you for a good vacuum as well.",It worked for our Kenmore 90 series gas dryer,1443657600,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Dryer Parts & Accessories', 'Lint Screens']",Lint Screens,Whirlpool,Tools & Home Improvement,30.16,0.6,Positive,0.0,6.5,0.0

I had to downgrade my review to 1 star. After having the regulator and the ignitor replaced, I'm now having to have the whole touchscreen replaced (which would have cost me $500 if they hadn't extended my warranty) because the Gas Lock keeps getting stuck. As in it won't fully turn on, and thus I cannot turn it off unless I keep holding the button and switching to Cancel for 5-10 minutes. Anyway, now my back two burners won't light. They are emitting gas, as I'm able to light with a lighter, but won't light on their own. I'm still so bummed because the unit itself looks so nice and I really like having the center large burner and double ovens! GRR!

Yikes. I've had nothing but trouble with my unit ever since I got it last May (2015). I've had at least 5 services calls, and two parts replaced. Unfortunately, GE customer service leaves a lot to be desired, and left me scrambling and frantically calling for a part replacement before my at-home wedding last September. First the ignitor was bad, leading to a slow ignite and flames coming out from the oven, then the burners needed to be adjusted, now the regulator is bad and I cannot use the Gas Lockout. For the price paid this is incredibly frustrating.

4099,4,,True,"11 25, 2012",A3B6QFFDVJEPM,B0077Z4PAM,Muzakologist,"I was replacing an element from a hot plate -- saving $5 by ordering the part and not a new hot plate.
I'd seen this listed as the ""universal"" element -- which this seller didn't, and good for him/her, because it's not QUITE universal.

It heats just fine. The problem was the bending of the leads, which the images on this product do not show. They are all from the top, straight down, so you can see the coils. But when you look at it from the side, you can see that it has dimension -- the coils that form the cooking surface are about an inch above the leads.

So far, no problem. But in my original, both leads bent upward at the same place, next to each other, and on this one, they don't.  As shown in the image supplied, the left element goes forward and inch or two, bends 90 degrees, goes straight up another 1"" (invisible in the picture, 'cause it's coming right at you) then bends 90 degrees to the left and begins the clockwise coil.

With THIS element, unlike my original, the right lead goes about 3"" before it has the 90-degree bends. This means that the two leads bend down from the surface level about 2"" apart. This would be fine except that my drip pan's holes for the leads did not accommodate that bend.  At all. And the material is pretty well unbendable (a good thing, probably), so you can't bend IT to fit.

So I bought a pair of tinsnips and cut my drip pan and made it fit. It's a bit ugly, but it works now. $21 later... oh well.

Here are some images of other elements so you can (sort of) see the geometry:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Whirlpool-Stove-8-inch-Surface-Burner-Element-9761345-8053268/dp/B002ZNNE12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Whirlpool Stove 8-inch Surface Burner Element 9761345 / 8053268</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Range-Stove-Top-Surface-8-Burner-Element-316442300/dp/B001K5M1UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Range Stove Top Surface 8"" Burner Element 316442300</a>

Judging from the other replacement range elements available, my old one is the weird version, not this one, so I still rate it high. But I do advise purchasers to check all three dimensions before selecting their item. And I remove 1 star because the little metal piece holding the two leads together is not adjustable, whereas it was held together by a screw on my old one, and I like that better for getting it in and out of the drip pan hole (was holes).",Check your angles!,1353801600,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Range Parts & Accessories', 'Burners']",Burners,ERP,Tools & Home Improvement,10.16,0.3,Positive,-0.1,8.2,-0.01

After 24 hours it was cold again so we reloaded the beverages and all was well for 1 week.  Then it started to loose cooling again.  I called Edgestar Warranty department where I got the worst Customer Service representative who claimed he was the manager.  Truly, never in 35 years have I experienced a person who literally did not know what customer service is.  He told me to move the unit ""3-4 inches out of its cubby"" and to make sure none of the holes on the shelves were covered.  Their are two whole rows of holes per shelf.  When looking at the picture of the frig this means that two rows per shelf can not have anything on them - thus it is not 148 can frig!!!!  Further, we have beer bottles in ours so we could only use two of the shelves so their is even more airflow in ours!  So basically you have to have the refrigerator sticking out 3-4"" from the rest of your kitchen cabinets and you have to put about 18% fewer beverages in it than is advertised.

After reading some great reviews here (Thanks all!) i grabbed a velvet hanger (thinking it will grab lint), removed the screen and gently cleaned the area at the bottom of the lint trap housing. Someone else mentioned disassembling the unit, which seems smart, but this worked well too. I pulled out about a softball size amount of lint! I also found a vacuum cleaner hose with a crevice tool worked well too as I could get it down into the area and vacuumed out even more after manual probing.

Received product literally within less than 24 hours which was amazing, kudos to Amazon. Installation was not difficult but a little time consuming and required a lot of disassembly. The product worked flawlessly for 1 year but failed a few days ago. I read further reviews and purchased a product that is suppose to be ""LG OEM"". I have my doubts as the product came in box that is obviously not from LG. For the price I am not really concerned and doubt you can actually find an OEM product for a 10 year old washing that appears to have issues with the drain pump. I installed the new pump from the bottom which was much easier and very quick.

4719,4,5,True,"12 2, 2013",AF7BKXZXCNJVL,B00CDWTQKI,Amazon Customer,"I've owned this dryer for a few months.  Overall it works great, it pulls about a gallon of water out of a large towel that was just washed.  It can, however be very difficult getting your clothes placed inside so that when it spins, it is balanced.  In general I try to only use it with a few items at a time to prevent excessive wobbling.  Sometimes I will have identical items of clothing placed inside perfectly spaced so you would think it's balanced, but it will wobble and automatically shut off.

It's hard to know where the ""heavy side"" of your clothing is so you can shift some of the clothes from the heavy side to a lighter side to get it balanced.  It might only take moving one item a quarter of an inch to the left or to the right to get it balanced.  You might have to adjust the clothes inside many times to get balanced enough to run.  If you run it while it is not balanced perfectly it makes a clicking noise.  The manufacturer states the life of the dryer will be reduced if it is run while unbalanced too often, so I put extra time in trying to get it close to perfectly balanced.

After all it is physics, if it's not balanced it will wobble, you can't blame anyone for that.  Overall, I would rather use this dryer than go out to the Laundromat so I give it 4 stars.  Since it uses no heat, you should expect to hang your clothes up for at least 4 hours.

Overall, I love the washer.  However, when I first bought it I was a bachelor.  I had no idea what ""HE detergent"" was and I used regular washing detergent and within a couple years I fried my first pump.  Sears told me that even though I had bought a service contract they would not honor it because I had used non HE detergent even though no where in the instructions did it say that I had to.  They were going to charge me $300 to replace the pump.  I bought my first replacement (for $40ish with postage) and put it in myself in about 20 minutes.  From that day on I used nothing but HE detergent and a few years later the pump went again.  When I went to buy a new pump I was told that they had a replacement pump.  Considering that i had fried two I thought that made sense.  The new model had a different plug and I cut off the old one and wired on the new one according to instructions provided.  This is very important because when I went to install this pump it had the old plug and I couldn't install it.  Why the 5 stars?  I don't think my issues were the fault of the pumps.

I replaced my bad drain pump with this a few days ago and have done several loads of laundry since. So far, it's worked just fine. This is not OEM, but looks and works like just it (except the one I got was green in color). The unit I received has the motor, impeller, and ""drain trap"" assembly, so it's a complete unit. Installation took about ten minutes. Being aftermarket I don't know how long it will hold up, but so far so good and hopefully it will last at least a few years. I assume it is made in China, but nothing was indicated so I can't say for sure. This seller shipped fast, and it arrived quite a bit earlier than expected plus the price was the best around. Overall very satisfied.

UPDATE 1/12/14

It's been just under five months and this part has totally failed. The impeller looks like it's sheared from is shaft, or whatever it would be called. The plastic looks like it's been torn up and is detached from the rest of the part. There is also a black rubber semi circular piece that's in there, which I can't figure out the reason for as the OEM didn't have it. In any case, this thing worked great for five months and now is completely useless to the tune of ~$90. I consider that unacceptable and the only reason I downgraded to three stars and not less is because I was able to find a replacement and that it worked.","Worked, then broke",1376956800,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Washer Parts & Accessories', 'Drain Pumps']",Drain Pumps,Whirlpool,Tools & Home Improvement,89.9,0.4,Positive,0.0,9.8,0.0

Maytag wants just under thirty dollars for this part (before shipping), and even third-party parts websites average from 12-24 dollars (before shipping).

Checked here, and lo! This is a compatible replacement for this model number (among many others).
It arrived quickly, adequately packaged.

Putting it into the filter screen slot, it went in fine 4/5 of the way and stopped! As though it were too wide at the top. D'oh!! Not wanting to force it/break it, I removed it. And cursed.
And went to my local parts store, where they assured me they had the correct replacement, for 12.99. Bought one, thinking it looked suspiciously similar. But what do I know,right. Alas - same part. Cursed again.

Then it occurred to me that a) I might have been wrong before, and b) now I had two, so what could it matter if I broke one?

Walked back to the laundry room with the orginal replacement, from Amazon, in hand. Crammed it in there, and when it 'stuck', pushed harder. And it went right in. Sigh.
So now I have two, which is all right, I guess. And now I know that I could trust this seller to start with, and the product was great all along.

I cannot say whether the replacement will hold up better than the original. It IS an exact replica,except for the color, with the same type of thin,poorly attached 'fabric' mesh and very thin plastic framing along the sides. This IS NOT a flaw of this seller's product, but rather a poor design on Maytag's part. Perhaps buy more than one..

After waiting the stated 4 weeks for delivery (with 2-day Prime shipping), I received pump 13708600 instead of 13708000.  The one I received has the outlet of the pump on the opposite side.  I didn't want to wait another month or more to get the correct part so I made do.  However, I am not happy about it.

I managed to re-route the drain hose down the other side of the machine, but I am worried that it is now too close to the shock absorber (a moving part) and may eventually be damaged.  This also meant that there was very little room to reach the pump mounts to tighten the bolts down, since the drain hose and wiring harness now share the 3"" between the pump and the side wall of the washer, directly where the mount sits.

Note that this was ordered as being sold by Amazon, but was drop shipped by a company in Texas.  As such I put very little blame on Amazon for this mix up.  However, I was extremely disappointed since I ordered this particular pump after reading reviews on other sellers saying they received the wrong pump.","Long wait time, wrong part",1380499200,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Washer Parts & Accessories', 'Drain Pumps']",Drain Pumps,Frigidaire,Tools & Home Improvement,90.01,0.6,Positive,-0.3,6.3,-0.05

I took the back off of the washer and removed the pump to find a nice chunk of metal stuck in there. The metal had actually worn away the impeller blades and hence the poor drainage.

This pump is a perfect OEM replacement. Install was super easy: 2 screws for the back cover, 3 screws holding the pump to the frame, two hose clamps, and one electrical connection. Replacement took maybe 15 minutes start to finish.

Two tips: 1 ) make sure you have lots of towels under the hoses and around the washer. If it is not draining, once you release the hose clamps, all that water comes out. It is not a ton but having towels to catch it makes cleanup a lot easier and 2) place a towel or rag over the opening on the back of the washer. It is just stamped sheet metal and is rather sharp. I got a couple of ""paper cut"" like wounds that would have been avoided if I'd covered the edge of the opening.

The 100 plus pound item arrived in a very skimpy cardboard box with VERY little packaging material (thin Styrofoam on the edges only). When I went to open it I tilted the box to one side and heard screws or bolts rattling in the housing. When I removed it from the cheap cardboard box, there was a dent on almost  EVERY panel. Not just small ones, but Quarter sized and larger. Thinking that wouldn't be the end of the world, I proceeded to forgive the bad packaging and was hopeful that the product would be good. Well, when I opened the doors, BOTH of them fell off. It appears as if the hinge pin which pivots the top part of the doors are too short. Being the eternal optimist, I opted to remove the top panel ( 2 simple screws to hold it down) to see if I could fix it. Well it was then when I was convinced that  it needed to be returned because ALL 3 of the screws used to bolt the metal panel where the pivots recess into were stripped out when it was manufactured, which means it NEVER worked properly and left the factory like this!!!! Oh-- I did find out what the rattling was in the housing, there were 2 nuts just floating in the housing which I could not find a home for.

The ""small"" is just a thinner piece of ice compared the the ""large"" which are thicker pieces. We had a party and realized we weren't going to have enough ice for drinks, so I started making some. Within an hour, I had roughly a full gallon-sized bag of ice cube for drinks! Bonus: The machine is quiet too!
Some tips: as the ice is in the process of making, constantly remove the ice cubes as they drop in the catch-tray. This is not a storage vessel, but just a catch, and if you don't empty this often enough, the ice will begin to melt. I dumped the ice into a gallon size bag and placed in the freezer in between runs. Since the ice is still wet, it will stick together, but with a slight tap on the counter, it easily breaks apart!
This ice is also really great to chew on!!
I highly recommend this product. No, it's not as small as a traditional ""rabbit poop"" or ""hospital ice"", but it's not bad either.

Im not satisfied or pleased by any portable ice machine maker that doesnt keep the made ice cold and frozen. Im sure in the summer time the ice will melt faster and run even more cuz like i said these ice makers r not sealed tight when closed to keep ice cold and frozen.

6071,5,,True,"03 7, 2017",A3NLV0WVQK0NOJ,B00INXG9MY,Archie Md,"Review is about RCA Portable Electronic Ice Maker.

Model No: RIC-102-RED....Appears to be identical to Igloo & other labeled 102 ice makers.
Importer and shipper:  Curtis International Imports, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, made in China

Item was shipped in original store shelf box as I neglected to specify plain brown box. Small ding from handling but with no visible damage nor apparent functioning.  The form fitting styrofoam packing protected it well.

WARNING
The user manual contains several warnings that should have been printed on the outside of the box, IMO. (Paraphrased)

1.  Ice maker should not be tilted more than 45 during transport or use.  Do not turn upside down.  (probably best not to turn upside down while unpackaging)
Allow 2 hours for cooling fluids to settle before use.  A youtube video by a seller suggests 24 hr rest after shipment.

2.  Needs dry level stable surface.

3.  Leave 8"" clearence all around for ventilation and component cooling

4.  Do not use hot water, room temperature or lower.

Package should have supplied warning notice on film bag about careful removal of clear packing tape on ice basket, ice scoop, and mechanical ice shovel.  As all interior components are white the tape is hard to see.  Interior space was a bit cramped.  Best to check nothing is left taped down to impede functioning with small flashlight.

Tested the unit to see if it worked.

Room temp 64F,  water temp 62F

Filled about an inch below max water line, which is indicated by very slightly raised lettering and dashed line, very difficult to see even with flashlight.  Fortunately the line is about a finger width below the breaking slope line of the container, readily visible.

From plug in time to first drop of ice bullets was timed at 7m 20sec with another 22 seconds before the ice shovel pushed the ice into the basket.  Harvest was 9 bullets about 3/4"" diameter and 1 1/8"" inches long on the large setting.  Continued test for four cycles with approx same time.

I'm happy with the results, performs as advertised and at a very good price, less than $100.  And the Candy Apple red color is way hot.

(I got the adjustable flow perlick faucets, and I got a tower cooler.  I also got tall tap handles that have a 2""x3"" spot for labels that I print out and ""glue-stick"" to it.  It really looks great!  To keep a very rough tally of how much has been consumed, I got a couple click type tally counters https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAZBPI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_63 that I click each time I pull a full beer.  It's not balls-on accurate, but it at least lets me know when I'm within a few beers of empty so I can order my next sixtel.
It has taken me a bit to get everything dialed in to prevent too much foam, but after some online research and experimenting, I'm getting some perfect pours.
I have a few issues with the fulfillment of this, but it shouldn't take away from the product review.  It arrived with some defects, and the assembly directions with the casters was confusing (no holes for the casters).  When dealing with Compact Appliance, they weren't the most helpful.  They'd only send a new one after they received this one back first.  i.e. I'd be without a kegerator for 2 weeks, with no way to keep my new kegs cold.  They refused to send a replacement out first.

So to contrast with the poor reviews tied to shipping damage--  My unit was really packaged well-- double boxed, hard rubber inserts in base corners, custom cut styrofoam to protect all corners.  Heavier duty cardboard on top and bottom of unit.  Protection for glass door.  I used to work for UPS and we would have considered the current packaging sufficient--  I'm not sure how much more they could do here without shipping on a pallet and charging way more.

Product:  Nice looking, colder option than Frigidaire, NewAir, GE around this price...  I want cool drinks not a wine chiller.  I liked that it has a handle, glass door.  Fan is nice too as some other units indicated inconsistent cooling but the fan equalizes the cool air.

Mine has a minor scratch on the door (top) that only i would notice-- it was under the protective film so I assume it was already there.  A bit of a bummer but again, being picky here.

Washes in about 15 mins- tho you can set it for less time. The spin dryer goes for 5 minutes  I and boom your done,, just hang stuff up and it's  a dry in a couple hours :) synthetic dries faster, like just  under an hour. I find that my clothes are still kinda dirty after laundry mat wash and this lil machine frankly gets stuff cleaner...like, here's a great example:
I had a white t-shirt with graphics on it that I washed at laundry mat. All I did was sleep in it, so didn't really get it dirty. But I had some white socks and underwear to wash, too, so I threw them in with just this shirt...was just 2 pairs of socks and 1 pair of under wear...again, all stuff I slept in only once. When I washed them, all this gross grey colored water came out of these clothes...has not used any soap, just a touch of oxiclean in the wonder washer. I rinsed my clothes 3 times, cuz apparently the oxi clean broke loose laundry soap dinge and build up. Stuff came out noticeably whiter once the water ran clear, and I am a believer in this lil machine!
I constantly use it now to stay ahead of the laundry piling up,and save laundry mat trips now for doing towels and bigger things at won't fit.
A good note is to not overfill this machine, cuz it rinses clothes better if you don't. I run it on a wash cycle, then put my shower head in and rinse a couple times til the water runs clear :) I love that I'm done in 20 mins between a wash and a spin dryer and only have to hang things up. It's a lot faster than waiting an hour and plus for the washer at the laundry mat. No line no waiting no quarters. I figure this and the spin dryer paid for themselves in under 6 months with just 2 of us :)
I did crack the lid near where the handle is on the bucket, but it doesn't seem to be a big deal, everything is still working great and not leaking :)
If you over fill it, it will splash a little on the floor so don't over fill past the line. Also, I put mine in a corner to make sure it doesn't tip or spill, cuz if you get it out of balance a little, it splashes a little bit too.i run mine in the bathroom of our RV and if the one breaks I'm buying another one cuz it's such a great help!","Saves me money, time, and clothes are cleaner!",1499212800,"['Appliances', 'Laundry Appliances', 'Washers & Dryers', 'Specialty Laundry']",Specialty Laundry,As Seen On TV,Office Products,59.97,0.7,Positive,0.3,12.9,0.02

- When I opened it I thought I had ordered an industrial-sized frozen Margarita maker by mistake. Which this is, without a freezing element or a spigot.

- I was AMAZED by the capacity. I did more than a dozen pair of white tube socks in a load. I washed jeans and underwear and a few tanks in a load. Granted, I'm only a size 28 pant, so judge accordingly, but I was afraid one pair would be the whole overloaded-load.

- The lid does not stay on. The ""locking"" mechanism is just sliding it around until it stops in place. Nothing holds it there. And...

- It walks all over the room unless you tuck it in a corner. I found it would NEVER work on a counter top so, in the bathroom, tucked between wall and pedestal sink with a towel on the the floor before it, it did just fine.

- The motion of the machine -- the canister does NOT ""lock"" onto the base as directions indicate -- WITHOUT FAIL will loosen the lid, which as I said previously, does not lock, per se.

- YOU MUST observe the max fill line. Even thought there's PLENTY of extra room up top, centrifugal action spins the water right up to the top and it will leak out if it's more than indicated.

- You will need to do a rinse cycle. Dump the water, refill, dump that, refill and then run it for another short cycle. This is the time to add your fabric softener.

- The lid, when pouring, will buckle just from the weight of the water and laundry. Be prepared to hold it in place or to pick laundry out of whatever receptacle you're emptying the water into.

These aren't made of high-temp plastic, so they do just that.
Secondly, the metallic rings that have the settings printed on them don't stick down on the knob worth a darn.  The adhesive isn't up to it, and the shape of the ring doesn't match the shape of the knob very well, so they want to pop off almost immediately.
Thirdly, the inserts need to be glued into the knobs, or they won't stay, and I had to do some filing inside the shaft hole to even get them to fit an ordinary Kenmore's controls.

Bottom line is, I wasted my money, and my time, and ended up going out and buying the more expensive, 'original equipment' type knobs I should have paid for in the first place.","If you like knobs that soften and deform when used on a kitchen range, then these are definitely for you.",1454889600,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Range Parts & Accessories', 'Knobs']",Range Knobs,DINY Home & Style,Tools & Home Improvement,9.99,-0.8,Negative,-0.5,3.9,-0.13

If the hoses leak, the hose was incorrectly installed OR it was started with water that was not within the temperature margin recommended by manufacturer (130 - 149 degrees F).

It even gives a chart on how much soap you should use depending on how hard your water is.  After following the manual, including how to load the dishes - I have not had a problem with it.

This thing is a big square carton that the ups man end over ended into my kitchen right in front of the door.  I cut open the box and tried to lift it but could not  get a good hold of it.  My fingers got wet gripping the bottom of the appliance but the box was not wet.  I decided to ignor the fact that there must have been water in the machine.

I had to wait for help to lift it off the floor.  It was only a couple days that I couldn't walk through the kitchen because of the spread of cut open boxes.  I knew going in that it was 3/4"" too tall for my countertop.  I had it put on my cuttingboard ""island"" but that turned out to be top heavy and unstable.  I found a shelving unit at a thrift store and thought it would be a nice project (I was still opitmistic).....I glued and clamped and sanded and stained and added casters and a new top.  Every step of that project fought with me as much as possible.  I got that done, had the dishwasher moved over to its new home, rolled it to the sink and found that the faucet adapter didn't fit my faucet.

There is a set of 3 adapters on amazon to make that right.  Many reviews said it solved just my problem.  I even paid extra postage to get it here faster, since  by this time I was anxious to use my new toy/helper.  None of the adapters worked.  I could not feel or see any threads on the faucet.  I opted to get a new faucet.

My son came from out of town and installed the new faucet for me.  It was fine last night.  Today after his departure, a leak developed.  I could wait no longer.  I hooked up the dishwasher hoses and fired it up (after throwing towels down in the cupboard and on the floor.)  It ran through the ""light"" cycle without a hitch. It does not make a lot of noise.  It seems sturdy.  My dishes are clean.

How does it perform? Bottom line is that I think it is a great replacement and I do no see a difference in performance.
A few things to remember:
- before use, and because it is pressed flat, wet it and place it in the groove as designed
- once a week, flip it upside down (same recommendation for any filter - it will make the wear even)
- I recommend adding this product (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holmes-Humidifier-Bacteriostat-H1709PDQ-U/dp/B000BRKYU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holmes Humidifier Bacteriostat, H1709PDQ-U</a>) to the water - cheap and goes along way (I still have the bottle I purchased 2 years ago and it is far from being over).

I got this Kegerator, Kegerator Tower Cooler, Beer line Neoprene Coupling Washers, Kegerator Cleaning Kit, and Taylor 5924 Food Service Classic Series Freezer-Refrigerator Thermometer (which hasn't arrived yet).  The cooling tower on this kegerator is lightly insulated with thin styrofoam (which seems adequate) similar to what you would see in packaging.  As I stated before I also purchased a tower cooler right off the bat.  Assembly was failrly simple with use of videos on youtube.  I experienced no leaks in CO2 lines that I know of at this point.  I se the temp on roughly 2 on the control and my retailer chilled the the Angry Orchard 1/6th keg prior to me picking it up.  I put the keg in the kegerator after getting it home and let it sit untapped for about 3 hours.  I then tapped it and set the regulator at about 13.5psi.  One note I would like to have seen a high pressure gauge on the regulator to show the pressure on the bottle to allow you to know how full your CO2 bottle is.  I  tried to remove the plug for the high pressure side and seems like it is ""locktite""d or something so rather than mess up the regulator I just tightened it back up and let it be.

It was time to get a replacement and this filter is much better.

If I were to be particular, I would say the quality fits the price per unit. I looked around for other types of filters and the nicer filters are at least double the price per unit. I settled with this pack mainly because I just needed something to cover the fan. The only difference I can tell is the noise the fan makes--it's louder.

You can throw in a load and then leave the house.  But I'm very pleased.

I drain and then refill and then wash again for a few minutes, then i drain and place load into the spin side.  sometimes it takes two spin loads ;to equal one load of wash.  So i spin half the wash load and then throw it in the dryer.  and then do the rest.  Its a great little machine.  I didn't have $500 or $1000 to spend on getting my machine repaired or buying another, so this is an awesome solution until I have the money.  and as previous posts state, ignore the skinny plastic tube and the instructions.  I put water into the washer via the old washing machine hoses.  I place the hose inside and turn on the water and fill it that way.  I've read that some people use a bucket.  It works great.  make sure dial is on normal and not drain, turn the other dial to the time you need for agitation and voila!  you are washing.  When you are ready, turn dial to drain and then place wet clothes into the spinner.  and then turn dial to the time you need for spinning.  and then you are done.

One person wrote that after a spin cycle he had to tip the machine over on it side and turn upside down to get the water out..... if the drain hose is laid out in the bottom of the shower or bathtub...... it should drain on its own.
Only spin small amount of washed clothes at a time and they should come out from 50% dry to 90% dry depending on the type and weight of the fabric. I wear under armor briefs and they come out 95% dry...... one pair of jeans still 40 to 50 % wet.

Since its just me, I thought this machine would be great.  I did a lot of research before purchasing.
This little machine has been a godsend.  I watched a LOT of videos on how to use it and Im glad I did because I was READY.

1. The instructions are hilariously awful.  At one point it says to spin the Revolution. I was like.. say what? Watch the videos. Its a pretty simple process.
2.  The intake hose is useless. It doesnt fit any faucet known to mankind. You will either have to buy an adaptor but my solution was to set it up next to my standing shower and use my shower head. When I first got it I used a bucket of water. Works fantastic.
3. You need to put this machine upright to drain it properly. There is no pump to drain the water out. It uses gravity.  I use two long wood boxes I have turned upside down and it works great.
4.  You will find that your clothes actually FEEL cleaner. For some reason maybe its the agitator is better, but my clothes smell and seem cleaner and fresher.
5.  Ok so LOTS of people run their clothes with a cycle with soap and then drain and then just put it in the spinner. Thats kinda gross, guys. To do a rinse cycle you just drain the tub and refill it and run a little 6 min cycle to drain the dirty wash water off of your clothes. Thats why rinse cycles exist.

Honestly you guys.. this thing is a 100 bucks DELIVERED to you.  It works. Its a simple design, which I actually prefer because its less electronic crap to go wrong. For not having to go to the laundromat or to my moms house for 4 hours while she inspects my clothes and comments on my underwear.. its great. I wish they had these when I was living in NY.

I cannot use public laundry facilities due to chemicals, detergents, and dryer sheets etc., so I got this to use in my living space/artist studio. I made an adapter (see videos on Amazon from users who show you how to do it) to hook it on to the water hose in my shower, and then I put it on chairs to drain the grey water into my bathtub using the gravity type of drain. I can't tell you how this has save me and my health issues! The load capacity is about half or less that of a normal washer, but that's okay for me. The motor is powerful and spins the cloths almost dry before I hang them on a clothes rack to dry. (My next purchase might be a small portable dryer to go with this washer). For the price ($100 when I bought it) you cannot go wrong! The only thing I cannot wash is large blankets or bedding or large heavy towels. I can wash bed sheets and regular bath towels just fine. It has a variable timer for wash and spin, but it is not based on actual time, it is numbered 1 through 15 (i.e.: it is not actually fifteen minutes, but I've never timed the cycle lengths). I HIGHLY recommend this little lightweight washer to use in dorm rooms, apartments or for anyone who suffers from multiple chemical sensitivities or similar illness and wants to be able to do laundry in a small space. It is so lightweight I can lift it up and down from chairs. (I while eventually get a rack on wheels that I can set it on and roll to and from the bathroom.) I suggest watching the customer review videos for more information.",LOVE This Mini Washer!,1515628800,"['Appliances', 'Laundry Appliances', 'Washers & Dryers', 'Specialty Laundry']",Specialty Laundry,Giantex,Appliances,12.8,0.8,Positive,0.5,9.9,0.05

Pros:
-Its compact and fits into a small space in my small bathroom.
-The gravity drainage system means I can place the drain tube in my shower without moving the unit. Because there isna slight lift into the shower, the tube doesnt empty entirely, but it isn't enough of an issue to concern me.
-This only requires a standard electric outlet to operate. There is no extra wiring or plumbing needed to set it up and operate it.
-The wash capacity is pretty impressive for a portable machine. I can fit nearly as much into it as the apartment machine Ive used for the past
6 years. You can add items to the wash cycle after its started, so its easy to ensure you're not over-filling.
-It gets your laundry incredibly clean. I included a picture of the water draining after a wash cycle so you could see how much dirt it got out. Embarassing but helpful.
-The spin cycle gets the items so dry! Seriously,
Im surprised every time.
-I can do my laundry without ever leaving my apartment!! This alone makes it worth every penny!

Cons:
-The water hoses for filling the machine are woefully short, and are equipped to hook up to no faucet Ive ever seen.  I may one day purchase longer hoses to allow me to fill the wash tub from my bathroom sink, but in the meantime Ive been using a bucket I fill from the bathtub.
-Its a little labor intensive. Manually fill the wash tub, run a second cycle to rinse, split the wash into two parts to spin, hang everythig to dry. This isn't the kind of washing machine where you can push a button and let it do its thing. It needs babysat, but for me, the work is worth it for the convenience.
-The spin compartment is so much smaller than the wash compartment. I imagine it has to do with  the motor placement, but its taken 3 spin cycles sometimes to finish off the load.
-Its a little noisy. I live on the top floor and am always worried about causing too much noise for the downstairs neighbors. Im going to purchase a mat for this to sit on to absorb the noise, and to keep it from walking across the tile as it agitates and spins.

Ive told so many people about this machine. It isn't perfect, but when you live in an apartment in a big city, you take the conveniences you can get, and this is a HUGE convenience.

I use it as my dirty clothes hamper, so I just wash when it approaches full.  If I'm not washing pants, I can usually wash 15+ articles of clothing between t-shirts, shorts, and underwear.  And plenty socks.  It'll take 15 minutes of washing, though I usually do 15 more minutes.  Then I spray lots of water in the washing compartment to rinse them out.  Afterwards, most batches take 2 sets of drying to dry.  Get it dry enough that I can put the clothes on a hanger and blow a fan at them and they be dry in a few hours.  When cold in the house, does take until morning.  (assuming I put it on the wash at 9PM and hang them at 10PM and not check on them until I wake up at 6:30 AM).

Love it though.  I've always been terrible about washing clothes, especially when I had to go to a laundromat.  Now I just cart the washer into the shower, fill with hot water, throw detergent in and turn it on.  It's great for lazy people like me as the cycles are so short.

As other reviewers have noted, the hose system has some major flaws. (The hose is actually completely useless.) I was too impatient to go the hardware store for a DIY hose-repair project, and filling the tub with a bucket works just fine.

If you're going to go with the bucket method, I would recommend dumping a full bucket of water on the clothes in the spin tub and then immediately turning on the spinner to rinse. Do that a couple times until the water coming out the bottom is no longer soapy. Rinsing in the wash tub seemed to take too many drain-and-refill cycles. Also, use about a quarter as much soap as you think you'll need. Getting the soap off was the trickiest part of the whole operation.

Some of the questions about the washer express concerns about the lack of a drain pump - I had absolutely no problem. Set the washer in the bathtub and the water drains right out. You don't need a pump.

The capacity is surprisingly large. I found that I could fit about half a regular size load in the wash tub, and about 1/3 of that in the spin tub. The spinner only takes 3-4 minutes, so it's not a terrible inconvenience to split the load up to ""dry."" Next day edit: I actually washed a queen size comforter in the wash tub. Had to take it downstairs to the community dryer to dry, but washing worked wonderfully.

Final note - you'll need a large clothes drying rack. The clothes come out damp-dry, but they still need a few hours on the drying rack. I originally bought the AmazonBasics Foldable Drying Rack - White, and after one day of laundry I've decided to purchase a more industrial size rack.",Neat little washer.,1506902400,"['Appliances', 'Laundry Appliances', 'Washers & Dryers', 'Specialty Laundry']",Specialty Laundry,Giantex,Appliances,12.8,0.8,Positive,0.0,9.8,0.0

Ive only had the machine a couple weeks but Im amazed at how well it works. It does require more work on my part, but Im glad I don't have to leave my apartment, so its worth the extra work. I fill mine with my detachable shower head, wash, sometimes twice for really dirty loads. Drain (the pump is awesome), refill to rinse, drain again and then put the clothes in spin dryer. I guess most of my loads have been smallish because most of the time I can put the whole load in the spin dryer. The dryer gets so much water out, the clothes air dry in just a couple hours. My biggest complaint is there isn't an effective way to remove pet hair. The lint trap inside the washer is fairly useless. Tumble drying with heat seems like the best way to remove lint and hair. Air drying leaves so much hair on the clothes, some of it can be shaken off when the clothes are dry, but most of it stays behind.

This ice machine reliably cranks out ice for home use.  By no means is this made for commercial use but to fill several glasses of ice for a meal, with more left over, it's great.  I have only used the small setting which seems to fit glasses well.  Of course, you can always bag ice ahead of time and keep it in your freezer for occassions where you'll need a several bags.  The chamber where the ice is kept is insulated but not refrigerated so the ice will eventually melt.  However the water reservoir is below the vented ice basket so the water simply refreezes into more ice.  It comes with a perfectly usable white plastic scoop but I bought a metal scoop because I liked the design.

Pros:
Preforms as advertised.
Quiet except for the occasional sound of ice dropping in the basket.

Cons:
This unit is fairly big and takes up a good bit of kitchen counter real-estate.

It came packaged well (no dents, etc.) - box within a box within an amazon box. It's relatively easy to adjust to length (measure twice... cut once...). Gloves are recommended since metal edges can be sharp. As other reviewers have noted, you will not get an airtight seal with this thing w/o a bit of investment of your time. Unless you want it to double as a humidifier for the room where the dryer is located, you should anticipate taping it with good quality metal/foil tape (e.g., the 3M/Scotch stuff). This takes a bit of time but is well worth it. The unit comes with two clamps -- a nice touch. Considerations will be different for different ""tight spaces"" but I found it easiest to install it onto the dryer directly, and then to a short run of collapsible/flexible ducting to allow me to climb out from behind the dryer and then shove it back against the wall.","Does the job, well packaged, ensure you have tape on hand to seal it",1518393600,"['Appliances', 'Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Dryer Parts &amp; Accessories', 'Vents']",Dryer Vents,"BUILDER'S BEST,",Tools &amp; Home Improvement,27.49,0.7,Positive,0.4,6.6,0.06

The area between my refrigerator side and freezer side was heating up as was the frame near the vent.  I noticed that my original fan was not spinning and would start only if I flicked the blade with my finger...I assume it got too gummed up inside due to dust, etc.  So I ordered this motor to replace it... and it worked great, with one exception.

The issue I had is that it is noisy compared to the stock unit (it turns 200 rpm faster).  I initially thought that was no big deal, but since our kitchen is near the living room I could hear it too often (like someone left the range fan on).  Anyway, I search and found a replacement fan that completely eliminated the issue (now the sound level is normal, quiet).

But.

It is NOT the most likely thing that will go out on your freezer. Learn from my experience!

If you have a freezer that *isn't freezing*, it is usually because it isn't defrosting. (The frost buildup blocks the airflow past the cooling fins.)
There are two *more likely* things to check and replace before replacing the relatively expensive heating element.

#1  The Defrost Timer ( Frigidaire 297318010 Defrost Timer) is VERY likely to give out eventually. It is just a mechanical timer, so it has a small motor that can go bad or its metal contacts can get fouled by the normal arcing that happens as it switches from refrigerate to defrost mode and back. This is super easy to get to and replace from the back of the freezer. It's about ten to fifteen bucks, so it's a cheap easy fix. (To diagnose, look for the little dial that you can turn. If you turn it, it will click and the freezer should turn off, then turn it just a little more and it should turn back on. If that happens, the contacts are fine. (If it doesn't turn the freezer off and on, then the contacts are fouled - so replace the timer.) If the contacts are fine, next mark a line on the dial and move it to the 12 o'clock position. Wait a few hours and come back and check it. If it is still in the 12 o'clock position, then the motor on the timer is dead, and you need to replace it. If however the timer has turned to, say, 2 o'clock, then the timer is still good and it is very likely that there is a different cause for the freezer to have stopped.

(I had to laugh when our 1960's refrigerator in our lab was freezing up and I quickly diagnosed it as the defrost timer...)

#2  The Thermostat ( Frigidaire 297318010 Defrost Timer ) is located inside the freezer, behind the bottom back panel, near the heat exhanger that looks like a radiator. (On mine, it was at the upper left corner of the heat exchanger.) The thermostat is fairly easy to get to, and you can replace it for about ten bucks. (Especially if it looks bloated or like it came apart at all, just replace it.) To get to it, remove the shelves, and unscrew the panel. Pull the dial for the temperature selector straight off, and unclip the temp selector from the panel. There will likely be a LOT of ice behind it, if you haven't already defrosted the unit.  If you still have to defrost it, unplug the freezer and place a fan inside of it (up on a couple boards to  keep it out of the melting water). Leave the door open and the fan going for a couple hours and the ice will all be gone, easily, except for the water all over the floor... I'd defrost it in the garage, or outside if possible.

#3  This defrost heater / heating element ( Frigidaire 216730700 Defrost Heater for Freezer ) is located under the heat exchanger, and is attached with some thin aluminum strips. It shouldn't really go bad, so I'd try replacing the above two items first. But if they don't fix it... well here's another forty or fifty bucks to throw at fixing the problem. Be careful with the aluminum strips that hold the defrost heater in place, and you can re-use them. (If they break, do NOT use a non-aluminum wire to hold it in place, or you could ruin your freezer!)

Other diagnostics:  (I haven't done these, but they came up in my searches and fixes.)
  If the fan doesn't run inside, that's a fairly obvious thing to replace, and looks to be pretty easy. Be sure to cycle the defrost timer to check it.
  If there is just not enough cooling, but there is no frost buildup and the fan works, then the temperature selector might be the problem.
  If the compressor doesn't run, there is a capacitor that I've seen come up as a replacement part.
  If nothing works at all - no lights, no fan, no compressor, then you might have had a power surge that blew out the computer board.",I fixed my freezer myself!,1442534400,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Freezer Parts & Accessories']",Freezer Parts,Frigidaire,Tools & Home Improvement,48.86,0.7,Positive,-0.1,14.6,-0.01

This refrigerator was manufactured in 2011. We bought one off the floor of an appliance store in 2016 - and they didn't tell us it was a 2011. It failed. We decided to buy one off of Amazon because it fits perfectly in our parents apartment. It was advertised as New.  It was not disclosed to us that this refrigerator is also a 2011 but is New because it was still in the box. The hinges broke in a month and a half. We contacted the company we bought it from and they said we had to contact the manufacturer.

Before you buy - you may want to consider trying to make space for the larger one. I measured my old fridge and this one fit into the space just fine, but with some empty space on either side. But with some slight rejiggering of my cabinets, I probably could have fit the larger one.

I am not lacking space in this fridge, but it would have been nice to have the extra 4 cu ft.

In summary, this is perfect for a small kitchen. But if you have the space, spend some time to figure out how to make the larger Fisher and Paykel fridge work.

9418,5,,True,"01 7, 2018",A74QUQLDGHVFZ,B00DJF6296,DymondDiva,"I bought this to replace my Best Choice twin tub washer.  It began leaking horribly.  I'm so glad I sprung for a better washer.  It's so worth it.  The hose doesn't attach to the sprayer on my kitchen sink but the unit is high enough where I can hang it into the drum to fill it.  I had to fill my old one with a bucket so this is a huge plus for me.  The drain hose even reaches into my sink I just attach it so it stays with duct tape and it lays against the inside nicely.  The washer runs extremely quiet.  Now for some tips.  If you manually fill with water the best way to wash is with the manual settings.  The programs are hard to time and know when to fill with water and pause etc.  I set my wash to 10 to 15 minutes depending on the type of clothes I'm washing.  I set the rinse to 1 to 2 min and the spin to about 2 min.  If my load is heavy with jeans etc I will run an additional spin cycle from 2 to 5 minutes.  The only time I get water leakage is if my sprayer gets water above the tub and goes on the side area inside the washer, it seems to leak out, just aim the water totally inside the drum and it's good to go.  Since my sink sprayer can lay against the tub I do not have to stand by it the whole time I only check occasionally to see if it's full.  Last hint.  If you are manually filling the washer it will not start if your water level does not match the load you selected.  For instance if you select heavy and the sensor doesn't detect enough water it will not start running.  Just pause the cycle add more water and start again.  On the flip side if you add too much water it will automatically drain until the sensor is happy.  This washer has made my laundry chore a whole lot easier, and no more buckets for filling and draining.  One more thing I do not have the wheels yet but I am able to slightly lift and carry this from one side of the kitchen to the other with no problems and I have a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder.",Best washer Buy Ever!,1515283200,"['Appliances', 'Laundry Appliances', 'Washers & Dryers', 'Specialty Laundry']",Specialty Laundry,MIDEA,Appliances,20,0.6,Positive,0.1,11.1,0.01

Ice was slowly accumulating in the vent just above the fan in the assembly, and the refrigerator failed the self-diagnostic with a 60E error, which pointed to this assembly as a possible failure.

The unit is an exact replacement for the original, and as I discovered when I removed the original, ice accumulation just above the fan had actually stopped the fan from turning. The assembly itself was not really the problem, which didn't really surprise me too much, but I had wanted to be prepared to replace the unit upon dis assembly, if the original turned out to be actually defective. I am still troubleshooting the root cause of the problem, and I now know that neither the ice maker and the Case-fan auger assembly is the problem.  I temporarily externally wired the fan supply and feedback line to monitor power to the fan, and feedback from it and confirmed that the unit is being driven properly, so that isn't the problem either. I'm close to deciding that it is just a bad design by Samsung, and I suspect that many of them fail with ice accumulation in this area, which over time blocks the fan output, and a snowballing ice accumulation that results in failure of the ice maker itself, until the accumulated ice is removed, temporarily fixing the problem . It is an extremely frustrating problem.

I attached an endoscope picture of the vent area where ice accumulates and blocks the fan discharge vent.

I've seen it before, but it really WOULD be nice if the switch lit when on as the translucent red plastic suggests it should. (It doesn't)

The hot side is fused IF you are set up for 125V. The neutral side in this case isn't fused. If you have 250V I presume both sides are hot and that presumably means one of the mains is NOT fused.

However, the switch is DPST, so you can at least switch both hot+neutral / mains.

Construction seems sturdy: terminals appear to be well-staked and none were wobbly.

The unit arrived well-packed (maybe the manufacture's listening to all the shipping complaints), I plugged in and waited for 24 hours, per the manual, for the unit to cool down. Then 48, then 72 hours, and nothing happened, even though the lights were on, so clearly receiving power. I called the manufacturer, who offered to send out a repairman, but after ten days, I called again to be told that I was outside the zone of any repairmen, so they would send me a new unit if I put my DOA unit in the dump. Not happy about contributing to landfill, I offered to return it to them at my expense to have them fix it, but they're not equipped to do this. No local charity wanted a broken fridge, so I paid my $40 fee to leave it at the dump, The new unit arrived within a week, and works perfectly. So, in my experience, you have a 50% chance of getting a working unit. If it functions OK, you'll find it's quiet, cools and freezes nicely, and has a deceptive amount of space on the inside. If it weren't for all the drama and forced landfill-filling, I'd be leaving a rave review, but the time, trouble, and cost of getting a satisfactory outcome makes for a two-star review.",Pay attention to the negative reviews!,1485388800,"['Appliances', 'Refrigerators, Freezers & Ice Makers', 'Refrigerators']",Refrigerators,Avanti,Appliances,66.7,-0.6,Negative,-0.1,5.2,-0.02

The best way to install it it to take the door off and lay it flat - it is very easy to do, and it makes the removal and installation of the new gasket a quick and easy job. My freezer door has an ice / water dispenser in it, so I had to disconnect the water line, and that was quite simple. Also - place the new gasket in the tub with some warm water to cover it. This will loosen it up a bit to make installation easier, and also take out some of the ""shipping kinks"".
I advise you to look at YouTube. There are several very good videos on the installation process worth the time to watch before doing the job. I recommend that you replace the refrigerator door gasket at the same time.
The only disappointment I had was the price! It seems like a lot of money for a piece of rubber gasket, but they gotcha - supply and demand! Lol!

Everything else about it is pretty ok.  At best.  My biggest issue is with the temperature control; the internal thermostat seems to be inaccurate.  I wanted to use this thing to lager the beer I brew, but that requires some pretty precise temperature control (lowered by 1 degree daily, then held at 35 F for a few weeks). According to my random temperature  samples, it's anywhere from 4-8 degrees off-target at any given time.  Granted, this is not a precision instrument, which is why it didn't lose a star.

The other reviews are correct, please avoid this product.  I don't like writing negative reviews, but this one deserves it.  Ordered July 19.  One month later, the machine still produces ice, but about half of what is advertised.  We installed a brand new water filtration device about 2 feet behind the supply line (installed by a licensed general contractor). LOUD.  Installed in our break room at my shop.  The ladies up front have had to close the door to the break room, as the machine is so loud they can't hear the phone.  It claims 40 pounds per day.  IF you dump the load the exact time it fills, you might get 30 pounds a day. If you don't, the ice in the basket will melt, and it starts production all over again.
Once a week, it goes into cleaning cycle.  Hopefully, it doesn't happen Friday night, or it will knock the tray off the spot, and will run water continuously until you reset the machine.  Hundreds of gallons of water will be lost.  It has increased my power bill 30%!!! The only way to stop this, it to shut down the machine, flip the screen over, and restart.  But then, you've got another 6 minutes of reboot time, and loss of at least 5 pounds of ice in that batch. And hopefully you're around when it happens, or it will continue to flush water until you manually shut it down.
Now, it makes good ice, when it does produce.  But, for the amount of money on the machine, the additional power, the lower quantity, it's not worth the money.  I could have purchased 400 bags of ice from a vendor, and still been ahead.
I regret this purchase.  I'm beyond my return time, but from what I've read, it wouldn't matter anyway.
Hopefully, I can convince anyone who takes the time to read this review, and discourage them from this purchase.  We don't have the fault codes, and the machine is on, but I don't have any expectations that it will last through the end of summer. While $520 isn't a huge hit for us, I imagine its a full weeks pay for someone else, and they will be sorely disappointed.
Either save your money for a higher end machine, or continue to buy it from the local gas station.",PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASE.,1503532800,"['Appliances', 'Refrigerators, Freezers & Ice Makers', 'Ice Makers']",Ice Makers,SPT,Appliances,610.08,-0.9,Negative,-0.2,12.5,-0.02

The only issue I had with this handle was that the lower edge which touched the fridge was not smooth so did not appear flush with the fridge door once fully installed. It is a minor issue so did not bother with replacing it with another piece.  The instructions were easy to follow.  The button in the middle of the handle works smoothly to open the outer fridge door.  I got the handle to replace the broken button on the original door handle.  It lasted about 4 years.,The instructions were easy to follow,1524787200,"['Appliances', 'Parts & Accessories', 'Refrigerator Parts & Accessories', 'Handles']",Refrigerator Handles,LG,Tools & Home Improvement,90.13,0.5,Positive,0.2,3.3,0.06
